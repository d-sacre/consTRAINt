# Licensing
## Project License
The project is comprised of objects with different licenses:
- The Project IP and all its related components is released under Creative Commons BY SA 4.0 International.
- All the code is under the MIT License (including all the Godot Addons used; see also "Acknowledgements").
- All the soundtracks and most of the other assets are under Creative Commons BY SA 4.0 International. Please see the dedicted license file for each asset for detailed information.

## Not all Assets available in Repository
Due to the license of some sound files, which only permit a non-extractable redistribution inside a finished (binary) product and not in source form, these files had to be excluded from this repository. The logic of the game is made in such a way the game can be built with this code base, but one has to add dummy sounds and change the file paths in <br> `res://settings/consTRAINt_sfx.json`!

# Acknowledgments
